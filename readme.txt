Project Summary:

IBM recently surveyed about the daily parking struggle faced by commuters in 20 different cities all over the world and found out that 30% of the traffic in cities is caused by drivers searching for a parking spot. Moreover, it states that the situation has not improved, if not worsened. We as driving enthusiasts could not agree more!

Historically, cities, businesses, and property developers have tried to match the parking supply to the growing demand for parking spaces and often failed. This situation demands immediate action and a solution which addresses our traffic congestion and parking woes. Readily available parking spaces will save commuters crucial time and generate revenue for the hosts with underutilized parking spaces.

“Parkway” drew inspiration from the parking issues in the city of San Francisco and aims to provide a convenient mobile app to users. Parkway, through the mobile app will provide a user-friendly interface to check available parking spots along with the respective booking options. It operates on the P2P operating model i.e. “Host” and the “Guest” can get in touch over the platform provided by Parkway.

The app allows users to either advertise their own parking space for booking or booking of the hosted parking spaces for users in need of parking space. Users can browse through all the parking spaces available and see the available slots for each parking before deciding to book a particular parking space. To reduce uncertainty and taking human behavior into account, we would only accept bookings 15 minutes apart. Whereas the guest who fails to check-out on time will be charged a certain extra amount. The guests who might not be able to use the space due to the unavailability will be refunded their money. 

The capstone project gives us a platform and an opportunity to embody the particular idea and apply the learnings from our coursework. The knowledge gained through courses like Database Management System, Information System Analysis and Design, Web Programming and Software Program Management will help us lay the foundation and make an impact on everyday commuter’s life.
